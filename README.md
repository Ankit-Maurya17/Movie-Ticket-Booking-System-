🩸 Blood Bank Management System

📌 Project Description

The Blood Bank Management System is a web-based platform designed to efficiently manage and coordinate blood donation, inventory, and transfusion processes. It allows blood donors to register, recipients to request blood, and administrators to manage blood stock, users, and requests — ensuring timely availability and delivery of blood to those in need.

This system aims to digitalize and simplify blood bank operations, making it easier to handle emergencies and maintain a ready supply of all blood groups.
